We are very much still an active group `on meetup <http://www.meetup.com/PySprings/>`_
despite the apparent lack of activity and a test-obsessed AI.

In fact, `one of our next meetups <http://www.meetup.com/PySprings/events/229079862/>`_
will be about ideas and work toward reworking and updating this site so that
it's used more. If you have ideas (and hopefully some time to help), please
join us on March 22!
