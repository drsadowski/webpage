I got an email last week asking if the group was still alive and I
realized that I had been a little complacent about updating the web
site.

We didn't end up having a meeting last month, doing a project night
instead. We're still trying to figure out something new for the website,
but progress has been slow. We first started looking into using
`pypress`_ (not the new tornado based fork) but since there seem to be
issues when using the Flask-Theme extension with Flask >= 0.8, it seems
less likely that we'll use it.

We had another project night today, with an emphasis on looking into
static site generators. Instead of repeating everything here, I'm going
to be lazy and just link to `the email I sent out earlier`_ :)

We're planning to have a regular meeting in two weeks on Tuesday, August
28th. I'm not sure what the topic is going to be yet but will be make
another announcement once we get that figured out.
