After completely forgetting to schedule either of the meetings last
month, we figured that it was time to stop resisting and set up a meetup
site for PySprings:

I've `scheduled the next meeting for 2012-12-11`_ about `pelican`_ - a
static site generator written in Python.

Apologies for the lack of communication recently. Both Ryan and I have
been busier than we'd like over the last month :(
