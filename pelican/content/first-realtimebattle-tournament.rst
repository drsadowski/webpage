We've been talking about this for a while now, but we've decided to run a
realtimebattle tournament this month.

There are no real restrictions on collaboration or code size but it will need
to run on python 2.7 with minimal external libraries. If it runs on the live image,
it will run on the "tournament setup".

The tournament will be a `round-robin style tournament <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament>`_
with the winner determined from overall wins (5 matches with each opponent).

Tanks will be due on or before 23:59 on October 20, 2013. The results will be
presented at a to-be-scheduled meetup on Saturday, October 26 2013. To submit a
tank, email your code to pysprings at pysprings dot org. In addition to the code,
please include the following information:

  * Tank name
  * Your name(s) as you want it/them to appear in the results

Please direct questions to the list - if you have a question, odds are good that
someone else will have the same question.

Good luck!
