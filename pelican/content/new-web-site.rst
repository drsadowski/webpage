As some of you may be noticing - we have a new web site! Ryan and I have been
working on the initial Pelican site for a while now and it's finally deployed!

What you see here is a first step, though and there are always things we could
add or improve. If you have ideas, feel free to bring them up - we have our own
VPS now and outside of system resources, there isn't much we couldn't do if someone
wanted to get it done. Suggestions are welcome and patches are even more welcome.

Some of the next steps are going to be:

* Theming the wiki
* Using OpenID or Persona for wiki auth instead of locally stored auth

I'm excited about the new site - the plan is to have everything from the blog
posts and css to the configuration management tools available publicly, so expect
more posts and probably some presentations about it in the near future.
