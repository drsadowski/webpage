This is the home page for PySprings, a Python user group based in Colorado
Springs, CO.

Our goal is to gather people interested in Python to exchange ideas and learn
from each other - whether you're a Python veteran or just interested in learning
more.

The group is very new and as such, will be evolving over time. If you're
interested in participating, feel free to contact us via email
(pysprings at pysprings dot org) or twitter (@pysprings).

Most group conversation takes place on our `mailing list
<http://pysprings.org/mailman/listinfo/list_pysprings.org>`_. Feel free to join
the conversation if you're interested!
