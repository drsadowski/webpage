The first PySprings meeting will be on June 26, 2012 from 7:00 to 9:00
pm at `the Enclave`_ in Colorado Springs.

Since this will be the first meeting, we'll spend some of the time
talking about what people's interests are and what times might work
better.

If you've never used Python before, don't worry! Ryan and I will be
showing up at 6:30 to help anyone install Python and we're planning to
spend the first 45 minutes talking about Python tools and Basics. We
have several options for the rest of the time and will go with whatever
the group decides to do.

* Introduction to `Flask`_
* Introduction to `PyGame`_
* Exercises from `Learn Python the Hard Way`_

We will have food, door prizes and a little bit of Python swag.

If you are planning to show up, please let Ryan or I know by sending an
email to pysprings at pysprings dot org, via twitter (@pysprings) or in
person so that we know how much food to get.

If you can't make it but want to go, let us know what time would be
better for you. We can't promise to change the time of future meetings
but we do want to make the meetings as accessible as we can.
