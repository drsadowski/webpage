The next PySprings meeting will be on Tuesday, October 23 at 6:30 pm in
`the Enclave`_ in Colorado Springs.

Keeping with the Flask/web theme, Ryan will be giving a talk on
`Jinja2`_ usage including inheritance, control structures, filters,
macros and whatever else we have time for.

Example code will be provided before the meeting but it would probably
be best to have Flask 0.9 installed ahead of time.

If you're planning to show up, please RSVP to me or `the list`_ so that
I can make sure to have an appropriate amount of food.
