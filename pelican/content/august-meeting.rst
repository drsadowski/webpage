The next PySprings meeting will be on Tuesday, August 28 at 6:30 pm in
`the Enclave`_ in Colorado Springs. I'm planning to do a discussion about
`Flask`_ - please bring a laptop as there will be code to work through during
the discussion. I'm trying not to make this a "Tim sits up there and talks for
an hour and a half" type of discussion.

Since we had so many environment setup issues last time, I'm planning to have
environments and livecds ready for people who don't already have python set up.
If you think that you'd like to use a pre-set environment, please let me know -
the hardware I have can support 8 at the absolute most.

Things you'll need setup on your laptop (let us know if you want help setting
things up):

* Virtualenv
* Flask 0.9
* Some sort of text editor (not notepad or wordpad)
* Python 2.6 or 2.7

If you're planning to show up, please RSVP to me or `the list`_ so that I can
make sure to have an appropriate amount of food.
