Despite the lack of updates here, we have been meeting regularly on the second
and fourth Tuesdays of the month. Check out `the meetup group
<http://www.meetup.com/PySprings/>`_ for details on what we currently have
planned.

Recently, we've been working on what we're calling the `PySprings Grand
Challenge <https://pysprings.org/wiki/PySpringsGrandChallenge>`_ (working title,
we still need to find a better name) in collaboration with the `Pikes Peak
Makerspace`_.

What is the Challenge?
======================

We're still working out some of the details but the original inspiration was to
do something similar to the `DARPA Grand Challenge
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge>`_ but simple enough and
cheap enough that more regular folks could participate.

The parts we have decided on are:

  * Robots will be involved

  * The robots will be autonomous

  * Robot "brains" will be programmable in Python (we **might** allow other
    languages too)

  * The competition will eventually take place in the Mars room at the `Space
    Foundation's world headquarters <http://www.spacefoundation.org/about/locations/world-headquarters-and-space-foundation-discovery-center>`_

We're still figuring out a lot of the details but plan to have a limited (both
in scope and participants) competition in October, 2015.


What's this Mars room?
======================

The mars room is an area of the Space Foundation's museum that has been
built to be a simulation of Mars and they currently use it for some robotics
programs.

Robots and Mars?! How can I get involved?
=========================================

Honestly, show up for one of the meetings (I use the term meeting loosely to
mean "folks gathering to get things done")! If you'd rather not wait, feel free
to ask questions on `the mailing list
<http://pysprings.org/mailman/listinfo/members>`_, IRC (#pysprings on Freenode),
direct email or meetup.

Future meetings will be scheduled on either the `PySprings`_ or
`Pikes Peak Makerspace`_ meetup pages.

There's plenty of stuff yet to do so don't be shy if you are interested!
